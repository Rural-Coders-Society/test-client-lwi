Deployment: Vercel -> Github Pages
Design Workflow: AI-Augmented Development (utilizing Gemini 3 Flash and GitHub Copilot)

Development Philosophy
To maximize community impact, efficiency, and maintain affordable pricing for local contractors, this project utilizes an AI-Augmented workflow.
Manual Refinement: Every line of code is reviewed and refined in VS Code to ensure accessibility, mobile responsiveness, and clean performance. However, it was all initially built by AI.
Static Priority: We prioritize static HTML/CSS over heavy CMS platforms like Wix in order to uphold our commitment to affordable websites.
